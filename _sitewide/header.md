As the Harrisburg reporter for[ StateImpact Pennsylvania](https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/author/mariecusick/){: target="_blank"}, I cover energy and environmental issues for PBS and NPR member stations statewide. Since 2012, I've closely followed the political, social, environmental, and economic effects of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s natural gas boom. I've also produced documentaries on the shifting legal landscape around&nbsp;[environmental rights](https://www.pbs.org/video/generations-yet-to-come-environmental-rights-in-pa-ckbsoy/)&nbsp;and the evolving debate over nuclear power. Previously, I covered science and technology for WMHT in Albany, New York.
