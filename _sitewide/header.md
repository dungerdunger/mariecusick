As the Harrisburg reporter for [StateImpact Pennsylvania](http://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/){: target="_blank"}, I cover state and national policy around energy and environmental issues.

The project is a public media collaboration among WITF in Harrisburg, WHYY in Philadelphia, and WESA and The Allegheny Front in Pittsburgh. [I write for the StateImpact Pennsylvania website](https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/author/mariecusick/){: target="_blank"}, and my reports air on public radio stations throughout the state. I also write for NPR.org and file radio pieces for national shows including Morning Edition, All Things Considered and Weekend Edition. I’m part of [NPR’s Energy and Environment team](https://www.npr.org/series/571910677/environment-and-energy-collaborative){: target="_blank"} which coordinates coverage between the network and select member station reporters around the country.
