  digital reporting.

As a producer for [PBS NewsHour Student Reporting Labs](https://studentreportinglabs.org/), I work with students and teachers across the U.S. on video journalism, media literacy, and covering issues young people care about.

My favorite part of my job is getting to meet amazing teens and young adults and helping to elevate their voices through journalism.&nbsp;

Previously, I was a multimedia reporter for [StateImpact Pennsylvania](https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/author/mariecusick/){: target="_blank"}, covering energy and environmental issues for PBS and NPR member stations. I got my start in public media in 2011 covering science and technology for public media stations in New York.
