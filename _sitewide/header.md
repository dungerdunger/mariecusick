As a producer for the [PBS NewsHour Student Reporting Labs](https://studentreportinglabs.org/){: target="_blank"}, I work alongside the next generation of journalists. Previously, I spent six years as the Harrisburg reporter for[StateImpact Pennsylvania](https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/author/mariecusick/){: target="_blank"}, covering energy and environmental issues for PBS and NPR member stations. I got my start in public media covering science and technology for WMHT in Albany, New York.
