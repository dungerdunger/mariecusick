  digital reporting.

As the Harrisburg reporter for[ StateImpact Pennsylvania](https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/author/mariecusick/){: target="_blank"}, I cover energy and environmental issues for PBS and NPR member stations statewide. I'm also part of [NPR’s Energy and Environment Collaborative](https://www.npr.org/series/571910677/environment-and-energy-collaborative){: target="_blank"}-- a team coordinating coverage between the network and reporters at local member stations. Since 2012, I've closely followed the political, social, environmental, and economic effects of Pennsylvania’s natural gas boom. More recently, I've produced documentaries on environmental rights and the evolving debate over nuclear power.

My work has been recognized at the regional and national levels– honors include a Sigma Delta Chi Award from the Society of Professional Journalists and a national Edward R. Murrow Award from the Radio Television Digital News Association.

Previously, I covered science and technology for WMHT in Albany, New York and contributed regularly to the station’s statewide public affairs TV show, New York NOW.&nbsp;
