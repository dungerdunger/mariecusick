As a producer for&nbsp;[PBS NewsHour Student Reporting Labs](https://studentreportinglabs.org/), I work with students and teachers across U.S. on video journalism, media literacy, and covering issues young people care about. Previously, I was a multimedia reporter for&nbsp;[StateImpact Pennsylvania](https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/author/mariecusick/){: target="_blank"}, covering energy and environmental issues for PBS and NPR member stations. I got my start in public media in 2011 covering science and technology for WMHT in Albany, New York.
