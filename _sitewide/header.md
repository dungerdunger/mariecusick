As the Harrisburg reporter for[ StateImpact Pennsylvania](https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/author/mariecusick/){: target="_blank"}, I cover energy and environmental issues for PBS and NPR member stations statewide. Since 2012, I've closely followed the political, social, environmental, and economic effects of Pennsylvania’s natural gas boom. More recently, I've produced documentaries on the shifting legal landscape for&nbsp;[environmental rights](https://www.pbs.org/video/generations-yet-to-come-environmental-rights-in-pa-ckbsoy/)&nbsp;and the evolving debate around nuclear power.

My work has been recognized at the regional and national levels– honors include a Sigma Delta Chi Award from the Society of Professional Journalists and a national Edward R. Murrow Award from the Radio Television Digital News Association.

Previously, I covered science and technology for WMHT in Albany, New York.
