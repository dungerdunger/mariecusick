Three years ago,&nbsp;[a report](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/19/us/19forensics.html){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;from the National Academy of Sciences exposed serious problems in the nation’s forensic science community. It found not only a lack of peer-reviewed science in the field, but also insufficient oversight in crime laboratories.

Little has changed since that report came out, but concerns are growing as scandals keep surfacing at crime labs across the country.
