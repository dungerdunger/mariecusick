Pennsylvania was one of the first governments in the world to recognize environmental quality as a basic civil right—much like the U.S. Constitution protects the right to free speech and freedom of religion. Article 1, Section 27 was added to the state's constitution in 1971, but its powerful language was ignored for decades. That’s starting to change.
