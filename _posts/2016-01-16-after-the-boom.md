In 2012 StateImpact Pennsylvania visited Towanda to see how the Marcellus Shale natural gas boom was changing the pace of life. We returned four years later to see what happened after the rigs left town. This story was honored with a 2016 Sigma Delta Chi Award from the Society of Professional Journalists.&nbsp; &nbsp;
