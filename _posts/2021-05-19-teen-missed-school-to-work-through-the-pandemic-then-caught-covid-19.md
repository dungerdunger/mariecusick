Itâ€™s been an incredibly difficult year for millions of teachers and students whose lives have been completely upended by the pandemic. Some teens, like 17-year-old Tiffany Rodriguez from Philadelphia had to become the family breadwinner-- putting their education on hold and their health at risk.

* *Things I did: Remotely produced and edited story, conducted all interviews and research. Coached the Philadelphia interview subject, Tiffany, to gather her own video for the story and share it with us. Coached San Diego-based student narrator to do the voiceover for the story*
* *Tools I used: Adobe Premiere and Zoom*
